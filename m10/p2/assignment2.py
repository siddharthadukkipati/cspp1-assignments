#Exercise : Assignment-2
implement the function hangman, which takes one parameter - the secretWord 
the user is to guess. This starts up an interactive game of Hangman between 
the user and the computer. Be sure you take advantage of the three helper
functions, isWordGuessed, getGuessedWord, and getAvailableLetters, 
that you've defined in the previous part.
